            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>J. <hi>Pechey</hi> Physician that lodg'd at the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>King-street</hi> near <hi>Cheapside,</hi> is removed to the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Basinglane,</hi> being the next turning beyond <hi>Watling-street</hi> in <hi>Bowlane</hi> from <hi>Cheapside,</hi> on the right hand, and the second turning in <hi>Bread-street</hi> from <hi>Cheapside</hi> on the left hand; his house is near the passage in <hi>Basing-lane</hi> that leads through <hi>Red Lion Court</hi> into <hi>Watling-street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His hours for attendance at home are from eleven in the morning 'till three in the afternoon, at which time the sick may have advice for nothing.</p>
            <p>And approv'd remedies at reasonable rates, such as have bin found by many years experience successful to admiration in curing <hi>fevers, agues, small pox, measles, colic, griping of the guts, bloody flux, vomitting and loosness, cough, chin cough, worms, rickets, jaundice, scurvy, rheumatism or pains and lameness, in the limbs, rheums in the eyes, many of the diseases peculiar to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the itch, running of the reins not always got by women, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ulcers or scabs occasion'd by the french pox and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may be truly affirm'd that in almost every parish in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> many of the inhabitants of all ranks have been cur'd by these incomparable medicines in the use of which with the blessing of God is such assurance of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that if these diseases have not been render'd incurable by ill management or other accidents, the cure of them shall be undertaken according to the following proposals.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A certain time shall be agreed upon for the cure of the above mention'd diseases before they are undertaken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The sick shall know first what the medicines will cost that are necessary for their cure, tho' they shall pay for them only as they use them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever is receiv'd for Medicines of them shall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully return'd, if the cure be not perfected with the time prefixt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they may be sure of having either their money or their health restor'd, they, or their friends for them, shall have a note if they desire it under my hand and seal, with what wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses they please to it for the performance of these proposals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And because many of the diseases above mention'd, necessarily require the Physicians attendance on the sick at their houses or lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I will visit them in any part of the City of</hi> London <hi>in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:196164:2"/>
               <hi>for two shillings and six pence, and will ride to visit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients in the City of</hi> Westminster, <hi>or in</hi> Southwark, <hi>or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs for two shillings and six pence a mile, the messenger that comes for me leaving the said fee at my house, and the name of the person that sends for me, and of the place of his or her abode.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very well known that many other diseases have bin frequently cur'd by <hi>J. Pechey,</hi> so that the sick may as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly find relief in most diseases at the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-lane,</hi> as any where else.</p>
            <p>My excellent purging Pills cure the scurvy, and dropsie, they purge the head, and cleanse and strengthen the stomach, for which they are highly to be valu'd, for from a foul and weak stomach proceed a great many diseases, they purge the reins, and cure the running of the reins, they purge the blood, and cleanse and strengthen the breast, they are as good a purge as can be us'd in the french pox, and indeed they cure as many diseases as any purging medicine can, they are put up in boxes, each containing eighteen Pills, price one shilling and six pence, with plain directions in print how to use them.</p>
            <p>My Electuary for agues, certainly cures agues of all sorts in the space of a few days; and is a sovereign remedy for that fever that accompanies consumptions, commonly call'd the hectic fever, price two shillings and six pence.</p>
            <p>Many ill men make it their business to reproach this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick way of practice, because it thwarts their interest; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly all persons that are free from prejudice will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve it, if they that practise after this manner, are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifi'd for the employment they profess, and therefore for the Satisfaction of such, I have thought it necessary to publish the following copy of a grant I receiv'd from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Physicians in the year 1684.</p>
            <div type="endorsement">
               <p>
                  <hi>KNow all Men,</hi> That the President, of the Colledge of Physicians with the consent of the fellows of the same has (by <hi>Authority from the King and Parliament)</hi> examin'd and approv'd of, and elected into our Colledge, the skilful and honest man <hi>J.
